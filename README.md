# About the application
## RootList
This app is completed as a test task where you can manipulate with the list of data
 both on the server and on the UI.

**Welcome to the Notes project! :bowtie:**

The app idea is simple:
+ an easy way to get access to your nodes
+ the ability to have your nodes data relevant with a help of api

Speaking about the app, there is only one page and it consists of a header and a main component.
This page represents the functionality of the project.

## *Main page: :smile:
   1. The user can add new nodes optionally but there is a validation
   2. Each note can be deleted anytime according to the validation
   3. There is an opportunity to edit each node from the nodes list
   4. The nodes can be hidden anytime depending on the user's preferences
   5. Modals are shown on each user's action
 
**The application was created using adaptive css :neckbeard:**

**Stack:** React, React hooks(useState, useEffect, useCallback), TypeScript, css-modules, axios, tabler icons.

**Deploy:** [https://repmacrypn.github.io/rootListTest/]
